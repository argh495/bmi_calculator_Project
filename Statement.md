Problem Statement

Maintaining a healthy body weight is a key factor in preventing lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disorders. However, many individuals are unsure about how to interpret their body measurements. The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple and widely accepted metric used to evaluate whether a person’s weight is appropriate for their height.
This project aims to create a Python-based BMI Calculator that helps users quickly determine their BMI and understand their corresponding health category.

Scope of the Project

The project focuses on building a terminal/console-based Python application for BMI calculation.

It performs BMI computation using the standard formula:
BMI = weight (kg) / height (m²)

The program categorizes the user into established BMI ranges (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

The scope includes:

Input validation

User interaction via the console

Cleanly formatted output

The project does not include advanced features such as calorie recommendations, graphical UI, or user data storage.

Target Users

Students learning Python programming

Beginners exploring basic arithmetic and conditional logic

Individuals who want to quickly calculate their BMI

Developers looking for a simple example project for GitHub or academic submission

High-Level Features

User-friendly console input for height and weight

Accurate BMI computation based on standard formula

Automatic classification into BMI categories

Error handling for invalid or incorrect inputs

Lightweight script with no dependencies beyond Python 3
