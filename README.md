BMI Calculator
Overview of the Project

The BMI Calculator is a simple Python-based application that calculates a user’s Body Mass Index (BMI) using their height and weight. It helps users understand their BMI category—such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese—based on standard WHO guidelines.
This project demonstrates basic Python concepts including input handling, arithmetic operations, conditionals, and clean console-based output formatting.
